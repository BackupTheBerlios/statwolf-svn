Q and A
=======

Q: What is this?
A; It's a tool to generate some statistics about your found geocaches from a CacheWolf profile

Q: Does it support gecocaching.com and opencaching.de Caches?
A: Right now it only works for caches listed on geocaching.com. However there might be a future 
   release also support opencaching.

Q: What do I need to run it?
A: You will need a Java runtime environment 1.5 or better and should have found at least one 
   geocache recorded in CacheWolf

Q: Is there anything to be configured before running the tool?
A: In the zip file you downloaded, there is a file called preferences.properties.sample. You can 
   can change the parameters in it according to your needs and save it as preferences.properties
 
Q: How do i run it?
A: If preferences.properties and StatWolf.jar are in the current directory, you can run it as
   java -jar StatWolf.jar
   If one of these files are not in your current directory here are some examples how to call it
   Windows: java -Dpreferences=c:\mystuff\preferences.properties -jar c:\Programs\StatWolf\Statwolf.jar
   Unix: java -Dpreferences=%HOME/preferences.properties -jar /usr/local/lib/Statwolf.jar
   Adapt paths as needed

Q: The wrong caches are shown as milestones. How can I fix this?
A: StatWolf uses the status field of CacheWolf to dermine the order you found your caches. 
   If you have found multiple caches on the same day, make sure there is also time information
   in this field.

Q: I never found a cache on Jan 1, 1970! What's wrong?
A: StatWolf uses the status field in the CacheWolf indexfile. If the field does not contain a
   valid date, Jan 1, 1970 is assumed. Please correct the date you found this cache on.


Q: I don't like the colors, how can i change them?
A: Inside the jar there is a file calles html:default.properties. You can save a local copy of this
   file as html_schemananme.properties and adjust colors or fonts. For testing your new file must 
   be in your current working directory. You also have to adjust prefrences.properties to point to
   you schema. Once you are satisfied, feel free to commit your schema to the community.
    
Q: I would like to add support for language xy. How can this be done?
A: In the jar you can find a file called maeesages.properties. Make a local copy and save it as
   messages_xy.properties where xy is the two ISO 639:1988 language code. Please refer to 
   http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt for a complete list. For non ASCII
